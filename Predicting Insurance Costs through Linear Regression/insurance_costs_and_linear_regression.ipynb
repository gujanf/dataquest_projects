    "The test MSE on the original scale was about 1.55, while the training original scale MSE was about 1.58. In this case, the two errors match up pretty well, so we can conclude that the model is not overfit. The residuals suggest that the model is predicting much lower costs for subjects who were actually charged much higher. Therefore the model struggles with these higher costs. As a whole, the model predictions are too conservative.\n",
